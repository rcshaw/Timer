# Timer
Ever have that one person who takes forever on a turn while playing board games? 
This timer will keep track of the time taken per player!

Finished Functionalities:

* Adding new players
* start/stop
* reset
* leading/fastest player
* swipe left to delete a player

TODO:

* change add player to modal (Justin's wishes)
* ability to manually input a time (in case of accidental reset, or something)
  this could be done maybe through a hold gesture
* cross-phone capabilities (this one will be hard).
